# CaseChecker

**CaseChecker** is a Python script that analyzes the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in a string. Based on which case appears more, the script will convert the entire string to either uppercase or lowercase.

## How It Works

1. The user inputs a string.
2. The script counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the string.
3. If there are more uppercase letters, it converts the entire string to uppercase.  
   If there are more lowercase letters, it converts the string to lowercase.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the **Python** folder.

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python case_checker.py
   ```

## Example Usage

```bash
Enter the word: HeLLo
HELLO
```

```bash
Enter the word: hEllo
hello
```

## Features
