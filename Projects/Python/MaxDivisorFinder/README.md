# MaxDivisorFinder

## Description
MaxDivisorFinder is a Python program that finds the number with the most divisors from a series of user-input numbers. If two numbers have the same number of divisors, the program will choose the larger number. The program ensures that only valid positive integers are accepted, providing an interactive experience for the user.

## Features
- Allows the user to input up to 20 numbers.
- Calculates and compares the number of divisors for each number.
- Handles invalid input gracefully (non-integer or non-positive numbers).
- Displays the number with the most divisors and the total number of divisors.

## Installation
To run the MaxDivisorFinder program, you need to have Python 3.x installed. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/InnovativeNoctis/MaxDivisorFinder.git
```

### Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd MaxDivisorFinder
```

## Usage
1. Run the program in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
python max_divisor_finder.py
```
2. The program will prompt you to enter up to 20 numbers.
3. After entering the numbers, the program will display the number with the most divisors along with the count of divisors.

## Example
```
Please enter the 1st number: 10
Please enter the 2nd number: 12
Please enter the 3rd number: 15
...
The number with the most divisors and the amount of them:
12 : 6
```
